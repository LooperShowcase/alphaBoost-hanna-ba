      The straight-forward definition of Loop is a Hi-Tech academy. Its purpose
      is to expose the next generations (called Loopers) to the world of
      computer science and technology and offer them a personalized fun-based
      educational method according to each student's preferences and ambitions
      in a well-structured and modular customized approach. Also, since it is a
      long-term program, Loop is built to guide the Loopers through the years.
      The mentorship aspect of it promotes the idea of a lifelong and ongoing
      system in which participants later may become mentors and contribute to
      the community and even become Loop partners, thereby completing the loop
      of knowledge.
      <br />
      <br />
      However, what makes Loop so remarkable is something that goes beyond codes
      and programming languages. It is Loop's Magic. Deciphering it means
      understanding what Loop means to Loopers and the mentors, something that
      transcends its initial aspirations. On an individual level, Loop — with
      its personalized methods — is continuously encouraging creativity and
      engaging participants to define their sense of self in their formative
      years. They feel seen, heard, and relevant, and that generates both an
      emotional and intellectual response that helps shape them as human beings.

      Not only that, but Loop also acts as a youth tech movement that encourages
      children to forge friendships with people their age and shared interests
      in this community. That feeling of belonging is vital for individuals
      going through a sensitive and eventful part of their lives. Learning about
      teamwork is a great asset to them, personally and, in the future,
      professionally.

      The mentors display an active role that is not restricted to the
      classrooms. They are considered role models (that is one of the reasons
      Loop has strict rules of conduct, such as no cursing, no discussing
      religion, politics, amongst others), but, more than that, they can become
      a representation of the future of the Loop. As mentors, partners, or even
      future investors. Mentors are an instrumental part of Loop, and the idea
      of becoming a mentor in the future may be very inspiring for some younger
      Loopers. When you are part of a growing, healthy community, you want to
      grow with it. Becoming a mentor can seem like a rite of passage, as well
      as a contributing part of Loop's system, which has already given you so
      much. The possibility of influencing others positively is exciting and
      uplifting.
